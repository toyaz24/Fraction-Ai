# Fraction-Ai

1)Clone the project from GitHub from master branch or download the ZIP file.

2)Navigate to the src folder of the project and run the following command in your terminal:
npm install
3)Check if there are no errors in the terminal. If everything looks good, run the command:
npm start
4)Once the project is running, you'll see the Fraction AI UI.
In the hero banner, there's an input field where you can paste the URL of any YouTube video.
After pasting the URL, the video will appear in the frame, and you can start and stop it.
The current timer will be displayed after the stop button on the input field.
If you start and stop the video at a certain time, the start and stop times will be shown in a modal that appears when you click on the submit button.
Before clicking submit, you can add a description of the video, which will also be shown in the modal along with the start and stop times.
To submit the start time, stop time, and description of the video, click on the "Confirm" button. If successful, you will see a toast message displayed in the top-right corner of your window.
You can repeat these steps to watch a new YouTube video on Fraction AI.
